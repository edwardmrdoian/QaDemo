🧰 Use Cases

You can use this mock API to practice:

✅ API automation with Rest Assured, Postman, or K6

✅ CRUD testing scenarios

✅ Schema validation and response parsing

✅ Test data generation and request chaining

✅ Negative test cases (e.g., invalid IDs, missing fields)

⚙️ Setup Instructions

Fork or clone this repository.

Keep the db.json file in the root directory.

Access your mock API using:

Start testing endpoints directly in Postman or from your test automation project.

🧾 License

This mock API is provided for educational and testing purposes only.
Feel free to modify the data, extend endpoints, or integrate it with your automation framework.

Would you like me to add a “Testing with Rest Assured” section at the end (with Java code samples for GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE)?
That would make the README fully ready for QA automation portfolio use.
